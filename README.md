# Integrated Security Vault 

This extensive program helps us to Generate what are called as "Passphrases" ; which according to its entropy is stronger than a password, which is just a string of alpha-numeric characters.

It Stores the passwords/phrases in a DataBases with is Fully Encrypted by hashing the passphrases and its corresponding user details.
